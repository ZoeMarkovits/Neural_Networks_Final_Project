# Neural_Networks_Project
Neural Networks and Deep Learning Final Project

## Data Source:
Kaggleâ€™s American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet dataset consisting of 870,000 images of the ASL alphabet, or single sign gestures. https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet. 

## Goal: 
We propose to build a neural network to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letter
signs as letters in the Latin alphabet. That is, the system will take an image with a handform as
its input and output a letter, the maximum value of the probability distribution over letter
targets. We intend to build and test two categories of neural networks: feed-forward multi-layer perceptrons trained on feature vectors generated from the training data, and convolutional neural networks trained on the pre-processed image files directly.
